				my brain still thinks you as a 17y/o curious latina I met few days ago a funny, cool and savage girl who says and do things so unpredictable that amaze me and makes me feel happy but damnn it's been more than 7months with you. <br />
				You don't know how much you mean to me...you don't know how much I adore you <br />
				<span class="comments">// (it made my eyes wet I'm thinking about past and all the things we did together like gaming and watching stuffs together and how you were watching me play 'tlou' from starting to last)</span><br />
				I can't just describe how much this all means to me. Ohh Vanessaa i just wanna hug you so tightly right now.<br />
				<br>
				<br>
				You know right you are my bestfriend and my soulmate .... My someone who is a  part of me and someone who makes me myself . <br />
				I'm grateful to have you in my life, I'm dammnnn lucky to have you in my life, thank you for everything my baby my little lady I love you soo much and once again HAPPY BIRTHDAY JULIETH ❤️<br />
